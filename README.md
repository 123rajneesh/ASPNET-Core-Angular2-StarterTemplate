# Angular 2 ASP.NET CORE 1.0 Starter Template

This is a starter template for developing Angular2 with ASP.NET CORE 1.0 Applications.

This template is done with npm. Its an Angular2 application with an http-service getting values from an ASP.NET CORE WebAPI.

Start by typing

<pre>npm install</pre>

at the level of the "package.json" file

You can copy the js files manually or use the gulp task

<pre>gulp get:started</pre>

Now you can just press "play" inside Visual Studio to get started.

If you change the *.ts-files you need to run the `tsc` command manually.

See this nice link which the Angular team did by working with Visual Studio and Angular 2 [Visual Studio 2015 QuickStart
](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/visual-studio-2015.html)
