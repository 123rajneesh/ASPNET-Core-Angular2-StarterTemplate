# Angular 2 ASP.NET CORE 1.0 Starter Template

This is a starter template for developing Angular2 with ASP.NET CORE 1.0 Applications.

This template is done with npm. Its an Angular2 application with an http-service getting values from an ASP.NET CORE WebAPI.

## Start

Start by typing

`npm install`

at the level of the "package.json" file

### Option 1

Now you can just press "play" inside Visual Studio to get started.

If you change the *.ts-files you need to run the `tsc` command manually.

### Option 2

`npm start` will run the gulp task for you, starting the lite-server and the tsc-watcher. You have to start the ASP.NET server manually by typing `dotnet run` separately.
